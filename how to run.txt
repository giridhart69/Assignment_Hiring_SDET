1. Got to Root Folder.
2. Open a terminal.
3. Type the following command "uvicorn main:app"

This way the backend will be switched on.

4. Navigate to Automation_Suite folder.
5. Open a new terminal again here.
6. Type "py main.py"

The test suite would run.

Since i didn't get a testable build i wrote a small web app using python, HTML, CSS & FastAPI
And implemented the same "longest substring" program in it.

To access the web app just type the url in the 1st terminal console.
ex : http://127.0.0.1:800 in my case.

All scenarios have been taken care in the program.

In case you need to execute main program, type this in a new console : "py main_program.py"
